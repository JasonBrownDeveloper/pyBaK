# pyBaK
This is currently just a parser for Betrayal at Krondor data files and some visualization tools.
Most of this work is heavily based on Guido's xBaK.
There are a couple of advancements over xBaK with regards to models and movies.
As with xBaK, this does require the original data files from Betrayal at Krondor, specifically:
frp.sx
krondor.001
krondor.rmf
startup.gam
